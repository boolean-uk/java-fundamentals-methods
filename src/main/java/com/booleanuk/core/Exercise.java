    /*
        A method is a function, a single piece of logic that can run. In Java, a class is a convenient
        encapsulation of related state and behaviour; members contain state (values like ints, strings, etc.),
        and methods perform behaviours. You've been using String methods in previous exercises, now it's time
        to start writing your own.

        Methods are defined by a signature line followed by a set of curly braces. The code inside the curly
        braces is the logic specific to that method, and any variables created in those curly braces
        are not accessible to any other method or class outside that method.

        The signature line describes the method and is constructed in the following format:
        visibility returnType nameOfMethod(inputs)

        You must specify what data type the method outputs (returnType) when it finishes running, or use `void`
        if it doesn't output anything. You can name a method anything you like but the name should be descriptive
        and short. Methods can also take inputs, which require data types and names, which is can use inside its
        logic. See the example below and take some time to break it down and understand it.
